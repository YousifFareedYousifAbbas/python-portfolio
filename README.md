# Python Portfolio

Welcome to my **Python learning portfolio**!  
This repository contains exercises and projects from my structured Python learning path, demonstrating my growth from **foundational concepts to intermediate programming**.

---

## 💻 Skills & Concepts

- **Core Data Structures**: Lists, Tuples, Sets, Dictionaries  
- **String Manipulation**: Indexing, slicing, concatenation, case conversion, reversal  
- **Loops & Conditionals**: `for`, `while`, `if/elif/else`, modulo logic  
- **Functions**: Reusable functions, parameter passing, return vs print, modular coding  
- **Problem Solving & Optimization**: FizzBuzz, LCM-based optimizations, clean and readable code  
- **File I/O & Libraries (Future Weeks)**: Reading/writing files, using Python libraries for automation and data processing

## 🗂 Portfolio Structure

| Week | Topics / Projects                  | Description |
|------|----------------------------------|-------------|
| Week 1 | Lists, Tuples, Sets, Dictionaries | Foundational data structures, loops, conditionals, basic functions |
| Week 1 | Strings & Loops | String manipulation, reversal, iteration, conditionals |
| Week 1 | FizzBuzz Function | Professional FizzBuzz implementation using LCM optimization |
| Week 2 | Intermediate Python | Nested lists/dictionaries, file I/O, modules & libraries, exception handling |
| Week 3 | Automation Scripts & Mini Projects | Combining learned concepts to build small projects and scripts |
| Week 4 | Portfolio Projects | Consolidation: larger projects, real-world applications, preparing projects for GitHub |

> ✅ Each week contains **clearly structured Python files** with **comments explaining the logic**.
